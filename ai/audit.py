ai/audit.py

DPDP-aligned audit trail for the query endpoint.

Why this exists
----------------
The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 asks two things of a system
that processes a person's query and returns a decision-relevant answer:
someone must be able to reconstruct what was processed and when (an audit
trail), and processing that depends on the requester's agreement needs that
agreement captured before it happens, not asserted after the fact. Neither
existed here — a query touched no persistent record once the HTTP response
left the process.

This module logs every query that goes through `AIService.answer()`: the
query text, the retrieval that ran, the confidence and citations returned,
and whether any of those citations required consent that was or was not
given. It follows the same SQLite-registry pattern as `ai/store.py`: one
file, one schema, one class.

Consent for licensed sources
-----------------------------
A `corpus.yaml` document can be marked `access: licensed` (see its header
comment). A query whose retrieval matches a licensed act, submitted
without consent for that specific act, has that citation withheld from
the response — the question still gets answered from whatever public
sources matched, but never from a licensed one the requester has not
agreed to use. This is a withhold, not a downgrade to "abstain":
abstention means the corpus lacks an answer, which is a different claim
from "an answer exists but the requester has not consented to it."

Consent is requested per act_name, not as one blanket flag, because DPDP
consent has to be for a specified purpose — "yes to everything the corpus
might ever charge for" is not that.

What is deliberately NOT here
-------------------------------
No PII scrubbing of the query text. The audit trail's purpose is to let
the query be reconstructed, which the audit-trail duty requires; logging a
redacted query cannot serve that duty. What DPDP's storage-limitation
principle does ask for is a retention bound, which is `purge_older_than()`
— call it from a scheduled job (see the gap-5 auto-update pipeline) rather
than never at all.
