"""Split a legal document at section/article boundaries.

The rule is: one section in, one chunk out. A section is never merged
with its neighbour and never cut in the middle of a sentence.

Naive regex matching fails on real statute PDFs in three specific ways,
so each has an explicit guard:

  * Table-of-contents pages look exactly like a run of headings.
    Guard: `_is_toc_line` (dotted leaders / trailing page number) plus a
    density check over the front matter.
  * Numbered sub-clauses and ordinary sentences that begin with a number
    ("14. of the said Act") match the same pattern as a heading.
    Guard: `_longest_increasing` keeps only candidates whose ordinals
    form an increasing run, which is what a real section list does.
  * A section longer than the embedding window still has to be split.
    Guard: `_split_oversized` cuts at sub-clause boundaries only, and
    repeats the heading on every part so each chunk stands alone.

# Target size in characters.
#
# These were 2000/3500, chosen so a section would usually survive as a
# single chunk: the citation is what the user is shown, and an unsplit
# section cites cleanly. The reasoning is sound; the sizes were too
# generous, and retrieval paid for it. A 3200-character section carrying
# one decisive clause dilutes that clause to near-invisibility -- BM25's
# length normalisation penalises the long chunk, and the term density the
# lexical pass depends on collapses.
#
# Patents Act s.3 is the worst case in this corpus: 3225 characters
# spanning (a) through (p), where (p) is the traditional-knowledge
# exclusion that much of this product's reason for existing turns on. It
# did not reach the top 30 for "Can a classical Ayurvedic formulation be
# patented in India?" -- the entire top 20 was Drugs and Cosmetics
# licensing, which says "Ayurvedic" often and says nothing about patents.
#
# Measured over the 17 answerable retrieval questions in
# ai/person_c_generation/eval, rebuilding the index at each size:
#
#     2000 / 3500   1763 chunks   Recall@5  58.8%
#     1200 / 1800   2274 chunks   Recall@5  82.4%
#      800 / 1200   2849 chunks   Recall@5  76.5%
#      600 /  900   3360 chunks   Recall@5  82.4%
#      400 /  700   4149 chunks   Recall@5  82.4%
#
# 82.4% is a plateau, so the choice is the cheapest point on it.
# 1200/1800 reaches it with the least chunk growth, and stays inside the
# ~2000-character window a 512-token embedding model can actually read --
# so it does not buy a lexical gain by truncating what a neural embedder
# would see once one is configured.
#
# Splitting does not cost citation quality: _split_oversized cuts only at
# sub-clause boundaries, repeats the heading on every part, and labels
# each "(part n of m)", so a retrieved fragment still says what it is.
