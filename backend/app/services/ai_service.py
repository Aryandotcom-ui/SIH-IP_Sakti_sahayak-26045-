        # query rather than a UX nicety (see ai/translation.py's module

        # source language; retrieval and generation run on the English
        # text throughout, and the answer translates back at the end.

        # The ordering matters and used to be wrong. The domain gate ran
        # on the RAW query, and its vocabulary list, its chit-chat
        # patterns and its emptiness check are all English. A Hindi or
        # Kannada question therefore matched nothing, tokenised to
        # nothing under the old ASCII-only tokeniser, and was refused as
        # "no_meaningful_terms" before it ever reached translation — so
        # every query in every language this product exists to serve,
        # except English, came back as "Outside supported scope". The
        # gate has to see English to judge English. Translation is not
        # the expensive step the gate was placed early to avoid (that is
        # embedding + retrieval + the LLM, all still downstream of it),
