GRATK = """WIPO TREATY ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, GENETIC RESOURCES
AND ASSOCIATED TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE

adopted by the Diplomatic Conference at Geneva on May 24, 2024

PREAMBLE

The Contracting Parties, recognizing the role of the intellectual property
system in fostering innovation, and desiring to enhance the efficacy,
transparency and quality of the patent system with regard to genetic resources
and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources, have agreed as
follows.

Article 1
Objectives

The objectives of this Treaty are to enhance the efficacy, transparency and
quality of the patent system with regard to genetic resources and traditional
knowledge associated with genetic resources, and to prevent patents from being
granted erroneously for inventions that are not novel or inventive.

Article 2
Use of Terms

For the purposes of this Treaty, "genetic resources" means genetic material of
actual or potential value, and "source of genetic resources" refers to any
source from which the applicant has obtained the genetic resources.

Article 3
Disclosure Requirement

(1) Where the claimed invention in a patent application is based on genetic
resources, each Contracting Party shall require applicants to disclose the
country of origin of the genetic resources, or, where that information is not
known to the applicant, the source of the genetic resources.
(2) Where the claimed invention in a patent application is based on traditional
knowledge associated with genetic resources, each Contracting Party shall require
applicants to disclose the Indigenous Peoples or local community, as applicable,
who provided the traditional knowledge.
(3) Where the information referred to is not known to the applicant, the
Contracting Party shall require the applicant to make a declaration to that
effect.

Article 4
Non-Retroactivity

Contracting Parties shall not impose the disclosure obligation on patent
applications having a filing date or priority date that precedes the entry into
force of this Treaty in respect of that Contracting Party.

Article 5
Sanctions and Remedies

Each Contracting Party shall put in place appropriate, effective and
proportionate legal, administrative or policy measures to address a failure to
provide the information required. No Contracting Party shall revoke or render
unenforceable a patent solely on the basis of an applicant's failure to disclose
the information, unless there has been fraudulent intent.
