"""Embedding backends.

`SentenceTransformerEmbedder` is what ships. `HashingEmbedder` exists so
the pipeline, its tests and CI can run on a machine with no model
weights and no network — it produces stable vectors of the right shape
but is *not* semantically meaningful, so `get_embedder` refuses to fall
back to it unless explicitly allowed.

Model choice: bge-small-en-v1.5 (384-dim, ~130MB). It is close to
e5-small on retrieval benchmarks, runs on CPU, and its asymmetric
query/passage prefixes matter for us — documents are indexed with
`passage: ` and queries with `query: ` at search time. Whatever you
pick, the retrieval service must use the *same* model and the *same*
prefix convention or the vectors are meaningless.

    """Offline embeddings that are actually about the words in the text.

    Why this exists alongside HashingEmbedder: the hashing fallback is
    deliberately meaningless, so an index built with it cannot be used to
    answer anything. On a machine that cannot reach the model host — an
    air-gapped deployment, a demo venue, a sandbox with an egress policy —
    that leaves no way to build a *usable* index at all. TF-IDF over
    character n-grams is crude next to a sentence-transformer, but it is
    directionally semantic: it puts "patentability" near "patented", which
    is enough to retrieve the right section far more often than chance.
    ai/person_b_retrieval/embeddings.py already relies on that property.

    The catch, and the reason this class carries state the others do not:
    TF-IDF has no fixed vector space. The vocabulary is learned from the
    corpus, so a query can only be compared against the index if it is
    transformed by the *same fitted vectorizer*. Fit once at ingest, save
    it beside the Chroma index, and load it at query time. Encoding a
    query against a differently-fitted vectorizer silently produces
    coordinates in another space and retrieval degrades to noise without
    raising anything — so `encode`/`encode_query` refuse to run unfitted
    rather than let that happen.

    Not the shipping default. `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` remains that;
    this is what you reach for when the weights are genuinely unreachable.
